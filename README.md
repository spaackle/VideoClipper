# VideoClipper
Simple tool that lets you create a clip from a video by entering the starting and ending times in minutes and seconds.

By default, it saves to C:\Clips, but you can change this in the code. You must have ffmpeg.exe in the same folder as cutter.py. You can download it by going here, then just extract ffmpeg.exe from the bin folder: https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/ffmpeg-git-essentials.7z
