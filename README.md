# VideoClipper
Simple tool that lets you create a clip from a video by entering the starting and ending times in minutes and seconds.

By default, it saves to C:\Clips, but you can change this in the code. You must have ffmpeg.exe in the same folder as clipper.py, which you can download from the ffmpeg website.
